# Scaffolding a new plugin

A new, bare-bones frontend plugin package can be created by running the
following command in your Backstage repository's root directory and selecting
`frontend-plugin`:

```sh
yarn new --select frontend-plugin --option pluginId=todo --option owner=
```

This creates a new NPM package named something like `@internal/plugin-todo`,
depending on the flags passed to the `new` command and your settings in the root
`package.json`. For more options, see
[the CLI docs](../../../tooling/cli/03-commands.md#new).

Creating the plugin takes a moment. Once the command finishes, you should see a
new folder `plugins/todo` with a structure like this:

```
/ <- your Backstage app's root directory
    /plugins/
        /todo/
            package.json
            README.md
            .eslintrc.js
            /dev/
                index.tsx
            /src/
                plugin.tsx
                plugin.test.ts
                index.ts
                routes.ts
                setupTests.ts
                /components/
                    /TodoList/
                        TodoList.tsx
                        TodoList.test.tsx
                        index.ts
                    /TodoPage/
                        TodoPage.tsx
                        TodoPage.test.tsx
                        index.ts
```

## What did we create?

Here is a quick overview of the key files:

- **`src/plugin.tsx`** — The main plugin definition. This is where the plugin
  is created using `createFrontendPlugin` and where page extensions are
  registered using `PageBlueprint`.

- **`src/plugin.test.ts`** — Tests for the plugin definition. Verifies that the plugin and its extensions are created correctly.

- **`src/routes.ts`** — Route reference definitions used for navigation between plugins.

- **`src/index.ts`** — The package entry point, which exports the plugin as
  the default export.

- **`src/components/TodoPage/`** — The main page component. It fetches todo
  items from the backend and renders them using the `TodoList` component.

- **`src/components/TodoList/`** — A presentational component that renders a
  table of todo items using `@backstage/core-components`.

- **`dev/index.tsx`** — A standalone development app that loads only your
  plugin. Run `yarn start` from the plugin directory to launch it.

- **`package.json`** — Notice the `backstage.role` field is set to
  `"frontend-plugin"`. This tells the Backstage tooling how to build and
  treat the package.

## Verifying the plugin

If your app has feature discovery enabled (the default), your plugin is
automatically picked up. Start the full app from the repository root:

```sh
yarn start
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:3000/todo` in your browser. You should see
the todo page with a header. If you also have the backend todo plugin running,
the page displays your todo items. If not, you see an error panel — that's
expected, and we cover the backend connection in a later section.

You can also run the plugin in isolation using its standalone development
server:

```sh
yarn workspace @internal/plugin-todo start
```

## Common issues

- **Plugin page not showing up.** Verify that `app.packages` is set to `all`
  in your `app-config.yaml`. If you use include/exclude filters, make sure your
  plugin package is not excluded.
- **`yarn new --select frontend-plugin --option pluginId=todo --option owner=` fails during installation.** Make sure
  you have run `yarn install` in the repository root first and that your
  Node.js version matches the one required by the project.
- **TypeScript errors after scaffolding.** Run `yarn tsc` from the repository
  root to check for type errors. A fresh scaffold should compile cleanly — if
  not, try running `yarn install` again.
